Project Plan::

1. Tasks

The project will be divided into the following key tasks:
Data Collection
•
Identify and gather the Mall Customers dataset.
•
Ensure data is in a suitable format for analysis.
Data Cleaning
•
Handle missing values (imputation or removal).
•
Remove duplicates.
•
Transform categorical variables into numerical format.
•
Normalize or standardize numerical features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•
Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
•
Generate visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
•
Summarize findings from the EDA.
Clustering
•
Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm.
•
Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow Method.
•
Validate and assess the quality of the clusters.
Visualization
•
Create visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent customer
segments.
•
Develop interactive dashboards in Power BI for stakeholder presentation.
Documentation
•
Document the methodology, findings, and insights.
•
Prepare a final report and presentation for stakeholders.


2. Resources

The following resources will be needed to successfully complete the project:
Human Resources:
•
Data Analyst/Scientist: Responsible for data analysis, cleaning, and modeling.
•
Business Analyst: To assist with requirements gathering and stakeholder
communication.
•
IT Support: To ensure the necessary software and hardware are available.
Software/Tools:
•
Python (with libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
•
Jupyter Notebook for development and analysis.
•
Power BI for visualization and reporting.
Hardware:
•
A computer with sufficient processing power and memory to handle data analysis
tasks.

3. Risks

Identifying potential risks is crucial for project success. Here are some risks associated
with the project:
Data Quality Issues:
•
Risk: The dataset may contain missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies that
could affect analysis.
•
Mitigation: Implement thorough data cleaning and validation processes. Use data
profiling techniques to identify and address quality issues early.
Algorithm Performance:
•
Risk: The K-Means algorithm may not perform well if the data is not wellprepared or if the optimal number of clusters is not correctly identified.
•
Mitigation: Experiment with different preprocessing techniques and validate
clustering results using metrics such as Silhouette Score. Consider alternative clustering
algorithms if necessary.
Visualization Limitations:
•
Risk: The visualizations may not effectively communicate insights or may be
limited by the capabilities of the chosen tools.
•
Mitigation: Plan visualizations in advance, ensuring they align with the insights to
be communicated. Seek feedback from stakeholders on visualizations to ensure clarity
and effectiveness.
