Final Report
1. Execu&ve Summary:
The customer segmenta1on project aimed to enhance the understanding of customer
proﬁles for a retail store, ul1mately leading to improved marke1ng strategies and
increased sales. By u1lizing the Mall Customers dataset, the project employed data
cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and K-Means clustering to segment customers
based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. The outcomes of this project
include dis1nct customer segments, ac1onable insights for targeted marke1ng, and
visualiza1ons that eﬀec1vely communicate the ﬁndings to stakeholders.
2. Introduc&on:
Project Background:
In the compe11ve retail landscape, understanding customer behavior is crucial for
developing eﬀec1ve marke1ng strategies. The retail store faced challenges due to a lack
of insight into its diverse customer proﬁles, resul1ng in untargeted marke1ng eﬀorts.
Objec&ves:
The primary objec1ves of this project were:
1.
To segment customers into dis1nct groups based on their purchasing behavior.
2.
To provide insights that can inform targeted marke1ng strategies and improve
overall customer sa1sfac1on and sales.
3. Methodology
The methodology for achieving the project objec1ves involved several key steps:
Data Collec&on:
•
The Mall Customers dataset was acquired, containing essen1al informa1on about
customers, including demographics and purchasing behavior.
Data Cleaning:
•
The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and
transform categorical variables into numerical format. Normaliza1on of numerical
features was also performed to prepare the data for clustering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•
EDA was conducted to analyze customer demographics and purchasing paSerns.
Various visualiza1ons were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to iden1fy trends and
rela1onships within the data.
Clustering:

•
The K-Means clustering algorithm was implemented to segment customers. The
op1mal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method, and the quality of
the clusters was validated.
Visualiza&on:
•
Visualiza1ons were created to represent the characteris1cs of each customer
segment. Interac1ve dashboards were developed in Power BI to present insights to
stakeholders eﬀec1vely.
4. Results:
The analysis and segmenta1on yielded the following ﬁndings:
Customer Segments: The K-Means clustering iden1ﬁed three dis1nct customer
segments:
•
High Spend, Young Customers: Younger customers (ages 18-30) with high
spending scores, indica1ng a preference for premium products.
•
Middle-Aged, Moderate Spend Customers: Customers aged 31-50 with
moderate spending scores, indica1ng a balanced approach to purchasing.
•
Budget-Conscious Older Customers: Older customers (ages 51+) with low
spending scores, indica1ng a preference for budget-friendly op1ons.
Visual Insights: The visualiza1ons highlighted key characteris1cs of each segment, such
as age distribu1on, income levels, and spending behavior.
Ac&onable Insights: The ﬁndings suggest that targeted marke1ng campaigns could be
developed for each segment, focusing on personalized promo1ons and product
recommenda1ons.
5. Conclusion:
The customer segmenta1on project successfully achieved its objec1ves, providing
valuable insights into the retail store's customer base. The dis1nct customer segments
iden1ﬁed through K-Means clustering can inform targeted marke1ng strategies,
enhancing customer sa1sfac1on and driving sales.
Key Insights:
•
Tailored marke1ng strategies should be developed for each customer segment to
maximize engagement and conversion rates.
•
The store should consider product assortments that cater to the preferences of
each segment, par1cularly focusing on premium oﬀerings for younger customers and
budget-friendly op1ons for older customers.
